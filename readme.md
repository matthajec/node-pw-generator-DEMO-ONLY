# Password Generator
This is a simple password generator that uses a dictionary of 980 common words arranged randomly. It generates a version where aprox. 50% of the characters are a version of 'l33tspeak', this effectively doubles the word list. I'm not a security researcher or professional. You shouldn't use anything generated by this for anything that needs to be secure, it's for educational/hobby purposes only. To use this program add a second argument with the value of "15". One of the reasons I'm not using this is because I don't fully understand how javascript generates psuedorandom numbers, but from my research it is not suitable for this task.

plain: 980 ^ n


l33t: 1960 ^ n

## Usage
Run the program with an integer representing the number of characters. So to generate a 5 word long "password" run ```node index 5``` in the terminal.
